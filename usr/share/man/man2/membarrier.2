.TH MEMBARRIER 2 2015-12-28 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
membarrier \- issue memory barriers on a set of threads
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <linux/membarrier.h>
.sp
.BI "int membarrier(int " cmd ", int " flags ");
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR membarrier ()
system call helps reducing the overhead of the memory barrier
instructions required to order memory accesses on multi-core systems.
However, this system call is heavier than a memory barrier, so using it
effectively is
.I not
as simple as replacing memory barriers with this
system call, but requires understanding of the details below.

Use of memory barriers needs to be done taking into account that a
memory barrier always needs to be either matched with its memory barrier
counterparts, or that the architecture's memory model doesn't require the
matching barriers.

There are cases where one side of the matching barriers (which we will
refer to as "fast side") is executed much more often than the other
(which we will refer to as "slow side").
This is a prime target for the use of
.BR membarrier ().
The key idea is to replace, for these matching
barriers, the fast-side memory barriers by simple compiler barriers,
for example:

    asm volatile ("" : : : "memory")

and replace the slow-side memory barriers by calls to
.BR membarrier ().

This will add overhead to the slow side, and remove overhead from the
fast side, thus resulting in an overall performance increase as long as
the slow side is infrequent enough that the overhead of the
.BR membarrier ()
calls does not outweigh the performance gain on the fast side.

The
.I cmd
argument is one of the following:
.TP
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
Query the set of supported commands.
The return value of the call is a bit mask of supported
commands.
.BR MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY ,
which has the value 0,
is not itself included in this bit mask.
This command is always supported (on kernels where
.BR membarrier ()
is provided).
.TP
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED
Ensure that all threads from all processes on the system pass through a
state where all memory accesses to user-space addresses match program
order between entry to and return from the
.BR membarrier ()
system call.
All threads on the system are targeted by this command.
.PP
The
.I flags
argument is currently unused and must be specified as 0.
.PP
All memory accesses performed in program order from each targeted thread
are guaranteed to be ordered with respect to
.BR membarrier ().

If we use the semantic
.I barrier()
to represent a compiler barrier forcing memory
accesses to be performed in program order across the barrier, and
.I smp_mb()
to represent explicit memory barriers forcing full memory
ordering across the barrier, we have the following ordering table for
each pairing of
.IR barrier() ,
.BR membarrier ()
and
.IR smp_mb() .
The pair ordering is detailed as (O: ordered, X: not ordered):

                       barrier()  smp_mb()  membarrier()
       barrier()          X          X          O
       smp_mb()           X          O          O
       membarrier()       O          O          O
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY
operation returns a bit mask of supported commands and the
.B MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED
operation returns zero.
On error, \-1 is returned,
and
.I errno
is set appropriately.

For a given command, with
.I flags
set to 0, this system call is
guaranteed to always return the same value until reboot.
Further calls with the same arguments will lead to the same result.
Therefore, with
.I flags
set to 0, error handling is required only for the first call to
.BR membarrier ().
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EINVAL
.I cmd
is invalid or
.I flags
is non-zero.
.TP
.B ENOSYS
The
.BR membarrier ()
system call is not implemented by this kernel.
.SH VERSIONS
The
.BR membarrier ()
system call was added in Linux 4.3.
.\"
.SH CONFORMING TO
.BR membarrier ()
is Linux-specific.
.SH NOTES
A memory barrier instruction is part of the instruction set of
architectures with weakly-ordered memory models.
It orders memory
accesses prior to the barrier and after the barrier with respect to
matching barriers on other cores.
For instance, a load fence can order
loads prior to and following that fence with respect to stores ordered
by store fences.

Program order is the order in which instructions are ordered in the
program assembly code.

Examples where
.BR membarrier ()
can be useful include implementations
of Read-Copy-Update libraries and garbage collectors.
.SH EXAMPLE
Assuming a multithreaded application where "fast_path()" is executed
very frequently, and where "slow_path()" is executed infrequently, the
following code (x86) can be transformed using
.BR membarrier ():

.in +4n
.nf
#include <stdlib.h>

static volatile int a, b;

static void
fast_path(void)
{
    int read_a, read_b;

    read_b = b;
    asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
    read_a = a;

    /* read_b == 1 implies read_a == 1. */

    if (read_b == 1 && read_a == 0)
        abort();
}

static void
slow_path(void)
{
    a = 1;
    asm volatile ("mfence" : : : "memory");
    b = 1;
}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /*
     * Real applications would call fast_path() and slow_path()
     * from different threads. Call those from main() to keep
     * this example short.
     */

    slow_path();
    fast_path();

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
.fi
.in

The code above transformed to use
.BR membarrier ()
becomes:

.in +4n
.nf
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <linux/membarrier.h>

static volatile int a, b;

static int
membarrier(int cmd, int flags)
{
    return syscall(__NR_membarrier, cmd, flags);
}

static int
init_membarrier(void)
{
    int ret;

    /* Check that membarrier() is supported. */

    ret = membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY, 0);
    if (ret < 0) {
        perror("membarrier");
        return \-1;
    }

    if (!(ret & MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED)) {
        fprintf(stderr,
            "membarrier does not support MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED\\n");
        return \-1;
    }

    return 0;
}

static void
fast_path(void)
{
    int read_a, read_b;

    read_b = b;
    asm volatile ("" : : : "memory");
    read_a = a;

    /* read_b == 1 implies read_a == 1. */

    if (read_b == 1 && read_a == 0)
        abort();
}

static void
slow_path(void)
{
    a = 1;
    membarrier(MEMBARRIER_CMD_SHARED, 0);
    b = 1;
}

int
main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    if (init_membarrier())
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

    /*
     * Real applications would call fast_path() and slow_path()
     * from different threads. Call those from main() to keep
     * this example short.
     */

    slow_path();
    fast_path();

    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
